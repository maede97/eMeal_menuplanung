Basic idea: Finding the correct category of an ingredient is a multi stage process:

(1) We convert the input ingredient to lower case.
(2) Check if the word is in the list of known ingredients, if yes, return category.
    We use error correction based on editing distance of a word. Up to two edits.
(3) If no, check if a sub-word is in known category. Also using max two edits.
